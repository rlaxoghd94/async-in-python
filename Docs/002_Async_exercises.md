# Asynchronous programming exercises in Python

Page dedicated to implementing and testing several python async exercises

## Exercises

1. Write a Python program that creates an asynchronous function to print "Python Exercises!" with a two second delay.
    - [my solution](../Exercises/002_Async_exercises/exercise_01.py)
2. Write a Python program that creates three asynchronous functions and displays their respective names with different
   delays(1s, 2s, 3s).
    - [my solution](../Exercises/002_Async_exercises/exercise_02.py)
3. Write a Python program that creates an asyncio event loop and runs a coroutine that prints numbers from 1 to 7 with
   delay of 1 second each.
    - [my solution](../Exercises/002_Async_exercises/exercise_03.py)
4. Write a Python program that implements a coroutine to fetch data from two different URLs simultaneously using "
   aiohttp" library.
    - [my solution](../Exercises/002_Async_exercises/exercise_04.py)
5. Write a Python program that runs multiple asynchronous tasks concurrently using `asyncio.gather()` and measure the
   time taken.
    - [my solution](../Exercises/002_Async_exercises/exercise_05.py)
6. Write a Python program to create a coroutine that simulates a time-consuming task and use `asyncio.CancelledError` to
   handle task cancellation.
    - [my solution](../Exercises/002_Async_exercises/exercise_06.py)
7. Write a Python program that implements a timeout for an asynchronous operation using `asyncio.wait_for()`.
    - [my solution](../Exercises/002_Async_exercises/exercise_07.py)
8. Write a Python program that uses asyncio queues to simulate a producer-consumer scenario with multiple producers and
   a single consumer.
    - [my solution](../Exercises/002_Async_exercises/exercise_08.py)
